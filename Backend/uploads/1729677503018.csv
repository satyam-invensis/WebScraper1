"InVent - HS"
"Business Objectives:"
"To develop a scalable AI/ML- enabled HS Code Classifier that automates the prediction and classification of HS Codes for physical goods in cross-border trade, thereby improving compliance with international customs regulations. The objective of developing the product is to optimise logistics operations by reduce human errors, expediting classification process, enhanced accuracy, reliable and timely HS code classification for clients operating in primary markets (logistics, international trade and transportation segments, customs office, ) and secondary markets (legal and tax consultants, companies having manufacturing outsourced, statisticians and any other interest parties)."
"Finding out Strategic Viability:"
"This product will complement and a tangent to the company's existing outsourcing services by introducing a solution tailored to clients in the logistics segment, with a potential for adding more features to cater to the multiple needs of the clients or expanding into new markets.
